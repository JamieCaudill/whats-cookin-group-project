## DESCRIPTION

What's Cookin'? is a group project completed as a part of Module 2 at Turing School of Software Design's Front-End curriculum. The application hosts a variety of recipes that can be viewed as a whole, by course (salads, hor d'oevres, main courses, sides), or searched by an ingredient to show relevent recipes. When looking at a recipe's page that recipe can be saved to the users saved recipes page. When looking at the saved recipe collection the user may delete recipes of their choosing.
